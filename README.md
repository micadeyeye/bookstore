bookstore
=========
This webstore is a complete web application for selling books. It contains both the frontend and backend of the application.

The application includes a dashboard for administering the inventory, customer information, courier/delivery options and many more.

It was developed for PHP 4.x and Mysql 4.x; it could however work on newer servers. The webstore and the certdump website were operated for a couple of years in some African countries. A number of book thumbnails are retained in one of the directories, and I am happy to give out the DB itself.
